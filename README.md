================================================================================================
People worked:: Dhruv Seth, Abhijit Parial, Debayan Santra, Vidisha Raj
================================================================================================



To run this application:
========================

1.Run the two binaries server and client, present in the folders server_app and client_app respectively.

2.Authentic users can be added to the server, from the interface, a username and password is been added "dhruv", passwd, "seth".

3.On the client side, there is a "test server" button, which is used to catch the list of files downloadable from the server.

4.If one wants to run on the same machine, both the server and client should have an ip as 127.0.0.x and ofcourse the ports should be same, otherwise also.

5.This application involves HILL CIPHER encrytion and decryptions, at server and client respectively, which promises a bit of security!!
